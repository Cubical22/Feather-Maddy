# FeatherMaddy

https://gamebanana.com/mods/467551

Hello everyone

Welcome to my first mod, *Feather Maddy* 

The idea is really simple, so is the implementation. Instead of dashes, you have fly feathers.
now, there are still limits:

1. As always, there is a time limit on the feather effect

2. Your dashes are your feathers, which means the entire refill mechanic applies to feathers as well.

3. Hitting springs while flying, makes it so that loose not only the effect, but also your dash. Instead, Dash into
 springs while flying

4. DreamBlocks can be used, but they are a little harder to use. Dash out of feather state next to a dream block,
 to simply use them.

5. The same thing from number 4 applies to every other dash dependent action (including feathers with shields, that 
are now almost useless :) )
