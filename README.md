# FeatherMaddy

https://gamebanana.com/mods/467551

Hello everyone

Welcome to my first mod, *Feather Maddy* 

The idea is really simple, so is the implementation. Instead of dashes, you have fly feathers.
now, there are still limits:

1. As always, there is a time limit on the feather effect

2. Your dashes are your feathers, which means the entire refill mechanic applies to feathers as well.

3. Hitting springs while flying, makes it so that loose not only the effect, but also your dash. Instead, Dash into
 springs while flying

4. DreamBlocks can be used, but they are a little harder to use. Dash out of feather state next to a dream block,
 to simply use them.

5. The same thing from number 4 applies to every other dash dependent action (including feathers with shields, that 
are now almost useless :) )

# Issues

since this is my first mod, there are some issues that require fixing.
for some reason the mod really dislikes chapters that have two dashes.
I tried so many different mechanics, and I chose my favorite to leave in the game.
when you have two dashes, you only get one feather, but get to do a normal dash after the use.

> *not intended, but* you can have two feathers, if you WAIT for the first one to finish

Also the hair color sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. I wanted gold to replace the blue color, but hey
, **it is what it is**.

version 0.8:
- added the "Feather Shine" ability, making the mod being a little more challenging
turn on this feature from the modMenu

version 0.8.1:
- fixed the bug where with the `Feather Fly` option off, the feathers
would still not refill your dashes after exiting.
